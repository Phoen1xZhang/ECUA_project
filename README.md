# ECUA_project

This is the repo for the CSE291A course project.

## Phase 1
The json files describing the agent tasks are under the 'tasks' directory.

## Phase 2

This repo contains the agent running on Environment 1.

We implement a simple agent (**mm_agents/my_agent.py**) which takes the screenshot as input and output the next actions to be taken. The agent is evaluated on the OSWord benchmark.

To run the agent, first install the requirements from requirements.txt, and then run **run.py** after deploying a local language model.
